<h2>To me, the best top 3 Movies are</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Top Gun 1 (1986)</h3>
<p>This movie is one of my favorites because of the two main actors. One is being Tom Cruise and another is Val Kilmer.</p>
<h3>Top Gun: Maverick (2022)</h3>
<p>This movie is no doubt one of my new favorite movies because Tom Cruise is in it and also the movie itself is remarkably hot shot.</p>
<h3>Alexander (2004)</h3>
<p>This movie is also great as it teach us the ancient history of civilization.</p>
