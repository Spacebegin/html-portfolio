<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Din and I am from Australia. 
  I Love fishing, playing football and swiming. 
  Day dreaming is a must to me, without it I can not simply function.</p>

  <p>During day time, I like to eat icecream. My favorites are fish, beef and pork.
    During night time, I like to learn coding as it is very important to me, because
    someday I would like to work as a professional hacker so that, I could hack my friend's  website (HAHAHAHA).</p>

    <p>Lets keep hoping to that!!</p>
